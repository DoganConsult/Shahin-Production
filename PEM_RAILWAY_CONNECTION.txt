PEM Server Connection Details for Railway PostgreSQL
=====================================================

Instead of localhost:5432, use these settings in PEM:

Host: caboose.proxy.rlwy.net
Port: 11527
Database: GrcMvcDb
Username: postgres
Password: QNcTvViWopMfCunsyIkkXwuDpufzhkLs
SSL Mode: Required

In the PEM installer:
1. Change Host from "localhost" to: caboose.proxy.rlwy.net
2. Change Port from "5432" to: 11527
3. Use the password: QNcTvViWopMfCunsyIkkXwuDpufzhkLs
4. Make sure SSL is enabled (it's required for Railway)

Note: Railway PostgreSQL already has SSL enabled and requires it.
