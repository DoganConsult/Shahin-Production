    "Access\tImmediate login\n",
    "3. Invited by Admin\n",
    "Entry: Admin calls /api/tenants/{tenantId}/users/invite\n",
    "\n",
    "Step\tWhat Happens\n",
    "Admin invites\tCreates TenantUser with Pending status\n",
    "User accepts\tSets password, becomes Active\n",
    "Role\tWhatever admin specifies (e.g., COMPLIANCE_OFFICER, RISK_MANAGER)\n",
    "Access\tAfter accepting invitation\n",
    "ChatGPT said:\n",
    "To make those 3 user-creation paths “real” and consistently active inside a GRC platform (and support a successful workplace operation), you need more than endpoints and statuses. You need clear governance, controls, user lifecycle rules, and operational ownership so the flows work reliably and pass audit.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Define the operating model (people + ownership)\n",
    "RACI for each flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-registration (trial): Product/Support + Security oversight\n",
    "\n",
    "Trial API provision: Sales/Ops + Security oversight\n",
    "\n",
    "Admin invite: Tenant Admins (business) + IAM/Security policies (central)\n",
    "\n",
    "Role definitions: what TENANT_ADMIN, COMPLIANCE_OFFICER, RISK_MANAGER can do (permission matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "Approval rules (when required): e.g., who can invite privileged roles, who can create additional admins.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Establish identity & access controls (minimum security baseline)\n",
    "These are the controls that make “Active” safe and compliant:\n",
    "\n",
    "Email verification for self-registration (already in your flow) + set a verification expiry (e.g., 24–72 hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "Password policy + secure reset (rate-limited, signed tokens, short TTL).\n",
    "\n",
    "MFA:\n",
    "\n",
    "Required for TENANT_ADMIN (and ideally all privileged roles).\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional-but-encouraged for standard users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Session controls: idle timeout, max session age, device/session revocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate limiting + abuse prevention:\n",
    "\n",
    "/register and trial endpoints protected against bots (CAPTCHA/turnstile, IP throttling).\n",
    "\n",
    "API provision endpoint protected via auth (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Make provisioning trustworthy (especially Flow #2)\n",
    "Flow #2 is the riskiest because it creates Active admin immediately. To make it “real” in enterprise terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Authenticate who can call /api/trial/provision:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use an API key per partner/system, OAuth client credentials, or signed JWT with audience/issuer checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authorize what the caller can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "Limit domains, tenant counts, and role assignment (prevent “anyone becomes admin”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Audit evidence:\n",
    "\n",
    "Log the provisioning requestor identity, timestamp, source IP, correlation ID, created tenantId/userId.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you cannot strongly authenticate/authorize it, you should not allow “Active immediately” without at least email verification or a secondary control.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Standardize lifecycle states and transitions\n",
    "To run cleanly in GRC, define a simple state machine and enforce it everywhere:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggested states\n",
    "\n",
    "PendingVerification (trial signup)\n",

    "PendingInvitation (invite created, not accepted)\n",

    "Deprovisioned (terminated, access removed)\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Only certain events can move a user to Active:\n",
    "\n",
    "Verified email + password set (flow #1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Valid authenticated provision request (flow #2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Invitation accepted + password set (flow #3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Record who/what triggered each transition (user action, admin action, system).\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Role & permission model that matches GRC realities\n",
    "Least privilege by default:\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not assign TENANT_ADMIN unless necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Separation of duties (typical GRC expectation):\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: a person who configures controls should not be the only person who approves evidence or closes audits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Role scoping:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tenant-level vs program-level vs module-level permissions (Risk vs Compliance vs Audit).\n",
    "\n",
    "Privileged role assignment controls:\n",
    "\n",
    "Only TENANT_ADMIN can assign other admins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Require step-up auth (MFA re-check) for privileged changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Tenant controls for trials (to avoid “trial chaos”)\n",
    "Trial duration enforcement (you noted 7 days):\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-expire and restrict access after expiry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep data retention rules clear: delete, archive, or anonymize after X days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limits to protect your platform:\n",
    "\n",
    "Max users created in trial, max invites, max storage, max API calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversion path:\n",
    "\n",
    "A clean upgrade flow that preserves tenant and identities.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Communications and UX (so it becomes “active” in daily work)\n",

    "\n",
    "8) Logging, monitoring, and audit readiness (core GRC requirement)\n",
    "You need evidence trails:\n",
    "\n",
    "Audit logs (immutable/append-only preferred):\n",
    "\n",
    "user.created, tenant.created, tenantUser.created\n",
    "\n",
